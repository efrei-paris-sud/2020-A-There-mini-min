# Project Title: Thereminimin
 **Description**: Our project is about making a Theremin, an electrical music instrument that crosses all frequencies (like a violin). It uses a proximity sensor as it is controlled by distance.

# Activity diagram for the project
For this project, we wanted the program to be as user-friendly as possible. Though it needed connection with the phone, the rest is pretty simple for any user to follow.

# First tests for the project
Before doing the project itself, we did some tests that will be related in this document.

## Testing the HC-SR04
The HC-SR04 is a small digital module that reflects an ultrasound to a surface. 

![HCSR04](https://projetsdiy.fr/data/uploads/2020/05/hc-sr04-arduino-schema-principe-trig-echo.jpg.webp?raw=true)

Our first test was about testing its ability to measure distance in cm. 
As a HCSR04 library is available in the Arduino Library Store, there was some examples of its usage like the "Simple" program that writes the distance.

After testing it in real life, we found out that the measures were correct.

We redid it with the ESON Board

## Testing two HC-SR04
Since a Theremin works with two inputs (volume and frequency), we borrowed a second ultrasound sensor to our classmates.
Now, we want to use two of these and see how they behave together. They work fine together.

Here is the code for this second test: 

```Arduino
#include <HCSR04.h>

UltraSonicDistanceSensor distanceSensor(4, 5);
UltraSonicDistanceSensor distanceSensor2(2, 3);


void setup () {
    Serial.begin(9600);  // We initialize serial connection so that we could print values from sensor.
}

void loop () {
    // Every 500 miliseconds, do a measurement using the sensor and print the distance in centimeters.
    Serial.println("SR_01: " + String(distanceSensor.measureDistanceCm(), 6));
    Serial.println("SR_02: " + String(distanceSensor2.measureDistanceCm(), 6));
    delay(500);
}
```

## Testing the output

we tried to make the RGB LED vary with the ultrasound sensors, however we couldn't appreciate well the results.

# Design the prototype

We used Fritzing in order to vizualize the design of our module

# Test the bluetooth
## Basic testing

We connected the ESP32S to an android bluetooth (classic protocol) and tried to send and receive message through the application Serial Bluetooth Terminal.

![Phone side](img/esp32phone.png?raw=true) 
![Computer side](img/esp32pc.png?raw=true)

We then coded a way to control our system through the app with a simple on/off option for a led.

![Led testing](img/esp32led.png?raw=true)

From then we needed to find a way to control our device from the esp32, we found the library Ble Keyboard who allow us to input keys in our device. It worked on computer but didn't on smartphone. We could abandon the idea of using our smartphone and using our computer instead, seen as once we have control over keys input we can do pretty much everything in a computer.
(As we can see, the library convert character to their mapped key, since it's of english origin it uses the qwerty format and not the azerty one, thus when we write "w" it read the corresponding key emplacement wich is a "z" on a qwerty keyboard)

# Creating the prototype

## Dividing the notes
As it has been proven to not be viable to have a continuous (and not discrete) range of values for both the volume and the frequency, we decided to divide our theremin's notes between **an octave** of values.

We decided, for the ease of movement of the musician and for them to not touch the Thereminiminâ„¢, to have a range of values between 5cm and 45cm between the hand of the musician and the instrument. Therefore, each octave will be spaced by a distance of 5cm. 

*this feature was later removed using the buzzer as we were able to use continious values.

## The code
We had been able to connect the ESP32 to an android phone through bluetooth, but now we had to be able to send continuous data (the distance between the hand and the captor), thus we had to use low energy bluetooth.
EXPLAINATION

This proved a challenge, for the application we were using for Bluetooth wasn't supporting it's low energy varient. We went back to research and found a code enabling us to create a server able to connect in low energy: 

![BLE server's code](img/BLE_server_code.png?raw=true)

At first, using the Kodular application (details in the following session) we didn't got any result.

![Kodular doesn't show anything](img/kodular_error_1.png?raw=true)

Apparently the application wasn't able to detect our device by itself. We had to resort to using another application to make a "first contact" between the ESP32 and the
android: Through a process called heterodyning, signals from the fixed and variable oscillators were mixed together. The frequency of one oscillator was subtracted from the other. The difference was amplified and, finally, output as an audible musical tone.
Once the contact was established, kodular was able to perceive multiple devices.

## Creating the app
### Choosing the right platform
We decided to create an **Android app** for Thereminimin, as an iOS app would be very challenging to make.

As we don't have much background knowledge in Kotlin or Java for Android development, especially for Bluetooth, we decided to go for a block-building app. Several options were given to us, and we tried all of them.

* **Thunkable** is one such development interface, working for both Android and iOS. However, the platform decided to change its functionnalities and thus weren't compatible with the tutorials we could find online.
* **MIT App Inventor** was given by Google.
* **Kodular** Uses the MIT App Inventor as it is open-source, however we tried several bluetooth functionnalities that couldn't work.

We decided to go with MIT App Inventor after about 40 hours of work.

### Following online tutorials
There is several tutorials available online. [Arduinofanboy's tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/ESP32-BLE-Android-App-Arduino-IDE-AWESOME/) was one of them that we tried to follow. It uses the older version of Thunkable, so we tried to implement his template to Kodular. We did changes to make the app read the values sent by the ESP32, since his work is about sending data to the ESP32.

![Kodular code](img/kodular_code.png?raw=true)

However, a lot of errors and issues happened

#### No extension can modulate the frequency

Currently, there is no extension available for the MIT App Inventor project that can [modulate the frequency](https://puravidaapps.com/extensions.php) : only the volume can be changed from 1 to 100 with the Taifun player. The approach we tried, therefore, was to create multiple (10) sounds at different frequencies that could be played according to the distance between the Thereminimin and the hand.

#### The Bluetooth extension doesn't work properly

An issue that happened multiple times was that the Bluetooth Low Energy extension doesn't work with the outdated extension available on the platforms (Kodular & MIT App Inventor). Thus, we had to update it manually. We tried to update this extension on Kodular, however the same errors kept happening, as the app couldn't find the BLE local devices. That is mainly why we switched to MIT App Inventor.

#### The app couldn't connect to the module

We currently do not know why, but the application, even though it is supposed to work properly, sometimes doesn't want to connect to the ESP32. Some people suggested to download a side app, named nRF Connect, connect it to the module and it would be supposed to work after disconnecting it and connecting it again to the homemade app. This solution works only sometimes, but is currently the only way we can connect our ESP32 to the Android Phone.

#### The app doesn't receive the data

This is the part that we are currently stuck on, as the app won't receive the data that the ESP32 is supposed to notify (which is supposed to be the Volume value calculated from the distance of the hand and the Thereminimin). This approach still isn't fixed, even though we tried all options available on the MIT App Inventor.

![The data won't send to the Android](img/data_not_sent.png?raw=true)

# The buzzer alternative
As we were running out of time and hadn't a sound producing system to present we decided to use a buzzer to at least show the viability of our project.
However the function related to the buzzer can only take one input at a time, thus we cannot control both the frequency and the volume without an additional element such as a potentiometer whith who we could have controlled the flow of current send to the buzzer through the on/off ratio of the period.
