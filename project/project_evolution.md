# Project Title: Thereminimin
 **Description**: Our project is about making a Theremin, an electrical music instrument that crosses all frequencies (like a violin). It uses a proximity sensor as it is controlled by distance.

# First tests for the project
Before doing the project itself, we did some tests that will be related in this document.

## Testing the HC-SR04
The HC-SR04 is a small digital module that reflects an ultrasound to a surface.

Our first test was about testing its ability to measure distance in cm. 
As a HCSR04 library is available in the Arduino Library Store, there was some examples of its usage like the "Simple" program that writes the distance.

After testing it in real life, we found out that the measures were correct.
